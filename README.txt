Exercise 3: Word Frequency

Included Files:
    * freq.py
    * README.txt

Running Instructions:
    1. In the directory containing freq.py use the command: python3 freq.py <input_file_name>
    
Notes and Assumptions:
    1. Some of the function headers include a full explanation of what the function is doing. Hence, I did not include comments in those functions since it would have been redundant.

    2. The dictionary uniqueWords is initialized in the global scope since it is used by multiple functions.

    3. The program only checks for the errors mentioned in the description. Therefore, the functions openFile and readFile don't have a "try" & "except" since I am assuming you will always be providing an input file located in the same directory as freq.py and will always be plaintext.
